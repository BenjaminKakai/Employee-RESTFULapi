# Employee-RESTFULapi
Great, let's walk through this entire project from the ground up:

1. The DemoApplication class:

package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication

public class DemoApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
 
		SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
	}

}

This class is the entry point to your application. It is annotated with @SpringBootApplication, which is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

@Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.

@EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.

@ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com.example.demo package, allowing it to find the controllers.

The main method uses Spring Bootâ€™s SpringApplication.run method to launch an application. This is the line of code that bootstraps a Spring Boot application.

2. The Employee class:

The Employee class is a simple Java class that represents an Employee entity with some properties (id, firstName, lastName, and email) and corresponding getter and setter methods. It also has a toString() method that returns a string representation of the Employee object.

3. The Employees class:

This class is a simple container for a list of Employee objects. It has a method that initializes the list if it's not already initialized, ensuring that the list is never null.

4. The EmployeeDAO class:

This class is annotated with @Repository, making it a part of the persistence layer in Spring. It handles the data operations on the Employee objects. The operations are very basic: getAllEmployees to get all employees, addEmployee to add a new employee, and deleteEmployee to remove an existing employee by id.

5. The EmployeeController class:

The EmployeeController class is the heart of our application, as it controls data flow into the model object and updates the view whenever data changes. It's annotated with @RestController, which means it's a web controller and the return value of the methods will be bound to the web response body.

@Autowired injects the EmployeeDAO object into the controller.

The @GetMapping endpoint (/employees) returns a list of all employees.

The @PostMapping endpoint (/employees) adds a new employee to the list.

The @DeleteMapping endpoint (/employees/{id}) deletes an employee by ID from the list.

Ultimately, this project is a basic RESTful web service that uses Spring Boot. It manages a list of employees, supporting operations to get the list of employees, add a new employee, and delete an existing employee.


how to add an employee to the list; 

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}' http://localhost:8080/employees


how to delete an employee from the list; 

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/employees/1
